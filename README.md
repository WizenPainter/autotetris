## Model Naming

The models that are names in this proyect have the following format (Jaime):

name of architecture(i.e resnet)_name of loss(i.e diff for the VarDiffLoss)_number of epochs_learning rate decimals(i.e 01 is 0.01 and 1 is 0.1)_date in dd/mm/yy format_initial of first name for whomever ran the model(i.e j for jaime).pt. A full example would be as follows

resnet_diff_50_01_29/11/22_j.pt
